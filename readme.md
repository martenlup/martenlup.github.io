This website is mainly used to create an appealing story to get an Apprenticeship next year.
That means structuring and designing an interesting website to showcase my skills and personality. <br>
Content:
 - embedded videos to showcase my personality
 - projects tab
   (raspberrypi, website, python bot??)
 - goodreads tab
 - blog/gedanken/philosophie tab
 
Design will be:
 - clean
 - focused on images
 - bright colors

I will use this website to learn HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This will also be improving my state of mind. Creating self worth and working towards a set goal.
Deadline for this Project will be 1/10/2020
